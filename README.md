# Compare NX vs Turborepo
> âœ¨A comparison of the [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) monorepo tool and the [Nx](https://nx.dev) monorepo tool.

This repository is a comparison of the [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) monorepo tool and the [Nx](https://nx.dev) monorepo tool.
We tried to make the two projects as similar as possible, so that we can compare them.
These are just minimal examples, so they don't do much, but they do show the basic features of each tool.
